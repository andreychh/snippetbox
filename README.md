# Welcome to Snippetbox

Snippetbox is a web application that allows users to paste and share snippets of text — similar to services
like GitHub’s [Gists](https://gist.github.com/).

This project avoids the use of complex web frameworks, instead leveraging the recently added functions in `net/http`
from Go 1.22. This choice allows for a more streamlined approach, making it easier to build simple applications.

Please note that this project is still in development and not yet fully functional. As I progress through the book, I am
continually adding features and refining the code.

## Technologies Used

- **Go**: The main programming language for building the application.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the frontend.
- **Go Templates**: For rendering HTML dynamically.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions or improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull
request.

## Acknowledgements

This project is inspired by the concepts outlined in the ["Let's Go" book](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/) by Alex
Edwards, which provided the foundational ideas for this application. While developing Snippetbox, I learned and applied
the principles from the book. I rewrote most of the code to improve its structure and incorporate my own design
decisions. This ensures that, although the foundational ideas are borrowed, the implementation reflects my unique
approach and understanding.
